# master_thesis
Repo for master thesis in algebraic geometry (E3Q3).

This repository contains an implementation of the E3Q3 algorithm by Kukelova [paper](<https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Kukelova_Efficient_Intersection_of_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf>).

The algorithm is implemented over the real numbers as well as over fields F_p, where p is a prime.
Based on the E3Q3 algorithm there is also an extension to solve for intersections of 5 cubic surfaces.
